# Machine Learning

## Q&A

- What is a float data type and how does it differ from other numeric data types
- What does *infer* mean (The machine will infer the rules...)
- What skills are needed to be able to learn Machine Learning
   - Linear Algebra
   - Probability Theory and Statistics
   - Calculus
   - Algorithms & Complexity
   - Data Pre-Processing

## Notes

- Fashion MNIST - A Data set with 70k images across 10 different categories
- The smaller the data set, the faster  the machine will learn
- *keras* is a framework for defining a neural network as a set of sequential layers
- A python library called *numpy* helps represent data as lists easily and quickly

## Buzz Words & Terms
- *labels*: *Answers* that are fed into a ML program are referred to as labels
- *model*: The result of *rules* created from the data and labels passed to a ML program
- *prediction*: The result of the data passed to the model using its rules it inferred from the training

## What is machine learning?

- Traditional Programming - You feed a program rules and data to get answers
- Machine Learning - You feed a program answers and data to determine the rules
